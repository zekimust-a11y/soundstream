## Soundstream: mandatory project context (read before doing any work)

Before taking ANY action (running commands, editing code, proposing changes), you MUST:

1. Read `PROJECT_NOTES.md` (repo root).
2. Read `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for architecture + current state.
3. Read `../DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md` for the current `.21` server state and deployment notes.
4. Treat `.21` as the runtime host. Do not start/assume localhost services. (LMS + Roon Core are separate.)

If any of these disagree with each other, STOP and ask the user which source is authoritative.

## Repo rule: commits are required

After making code changes, always:
1. Stage the modified files with `git add`
2. Commit with a descriptive message
