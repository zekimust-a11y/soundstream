# Soundstream — Cursor Agent Operational Notes (Deprecated)

This file exists only to satisfy legacy “read before work” checklists.

**Do not use this as the canonical operational guide.**

### Canonical docs (read these instead)

- `PROJECT_NOTES.md` (repo root) — the entrypoint for all project notes
- `soundstream/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` — architecture + current state
- `DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md` (repo root) — current `.21` deployment status

### Critical operational rule

- **Do not change settings on the LMS web UI without asking the user first.**
